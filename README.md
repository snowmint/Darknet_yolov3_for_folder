# Darknet_yolov3_for_folder
Since YOLOv3 seems didn't provide multiple file detection, this repository try to implement a "simple way" to let detection more eazier.

This code just made for my personal use so the execute command is lack of flexibility. If someone need it I will work on more completely.
